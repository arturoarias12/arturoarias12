I found a mission: use information and automation to give people back time and make work and life easier. That professional purpose clicked the day I wrote a small program  that reduced the time that a tedious step took and returned focus to my day. Since then I have built systems that range from personal projects like a simple luggage-packing helper app to web analytics data pipelines handling millions of records, always with the same aim: reduce friction, increase impact, and create room for people to do their best work.

As an igniter of initiatives, in Peru, I helped bring AIChE  to new ground by founding the AIChE-UTEC student chapter, rallying classmates, mentoring younger students, and turning ideas into momentum. Dreams are meant to be pursued, and part of my purpose is to be a guiding light for others, to open doors, create pathways, and show that the journey is possible for those who dare to follow it.

I am a lifelong learner, wired to understand not only how things work, but also how they can work better. That curiosity carried me from Chemical Engineering into Data Science, Data Analytics, Business Intelligence and AI, fields where I can design a better future for the people and systems that shape our world. Along that learning journey and professional transition, I learned to be resilient, becoming resourceful by using the tools I had available and turning challenges into fuel for motivation. Growth demands patience, grit, and adaptability, and I continuously invest in the work of becoming better as a professional and as a person.

The world and humanity are currently facing challenges unlike any seen before: complex, fast-moving, and high-stakes. I am ready for that, motivated, disciplined, and committed to doing my best. If you are building tools that return time to people and turn data into better decisions, let us connect and create systems that free teams to focus on the work only humans can do.
